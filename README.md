Note: This project is still heavily and actively in development. 

Things Left to do:
- Add scanning to Merge Sort
- Correct comparisons & curr bar for Merge Sort
- Add buffering to Merge Sort
- Additional options for new array set (worst case, reverse etc)
- Other sorting algorithms (heap sort, bucket sort, radix sort etc)
